## How To Edit The gh-pages

1) Clone this specific branch
2) All edits need to be done in the docs folder on *.rst files
3) Inside the docs folder run the command "make clean && make html"
4) For the html web pages to be properly built in gh-pages you will need to move all files from docs/_build/html to the head of the branch
