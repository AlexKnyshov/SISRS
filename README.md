This branch is only meant to hold the Dockerfile that was used to build the docker image located at docker://mcconnell22/sisrs:2.0. In case of the need for future updates.

This docker image is a Ubuntu based image and has all the necessary software pre-installed to run *SISRS* and a few extra packages you can find on everyday servers.

Instructions to use our docker image can be found on our [website](https://schwartzlaburi.github.io/SISRS/), by navigating to the software setup page under Docker or Singularity.
